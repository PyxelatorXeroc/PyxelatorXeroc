Hello, I'm PyxelatorXeroc.
I'm a Terraria player, as most Terraria players know. I'm quite famous :)
I'm learning  C# and Python.
I am interested in Terraria modding (and anything else Terraria-related) and I also use Unity for making video games.

My discord is Xeroc#3288 for anything you want to contact me for.
