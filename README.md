Hello, I'm PyxelatorXeroc (or just Xeroc or Pyxelator if you prefer).
I'm a Terraria person, as most Terrarians will know.
I'm learning basic C# and Python.
I would be happy to contribute to modding projects and basically everything else Terraria-related.
My discord is Xeroc#3288, and my email is contactxeroc@gmail.com.
Thank you!
